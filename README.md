 Ollama is a tool that allows you to run open-source large language models (LLMs) locally.


Locally-Run Models: These advanced artificial intelligence systems operate directly on a userâ€™s device, circumventing the need for external servers. This decentralized approach ensures greater privacy, reduced latency, and enhanced control over data.



Large Language Models: Large language models are AI systems trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to comprehend and generate human-like text across diverse contexts. By analyzing patterns within the data, these models can predict and generate coherent sequences of text.
